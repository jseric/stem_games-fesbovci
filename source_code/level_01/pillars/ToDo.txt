Ancient Greeks are famous for building beautiful temples.

Their temples are built with one of three styles of pillars: 
round (), square [] and curly {}.

Each style of pillars has its opening and closing variant, 
for example, the curly pillars' opening pillar looks like '{', 
and the closing pillar like '}'.

For a temple to remain standing without risk of collapsing,
each one of its opening pillars should have its corresponding closing pillar present.
 
Also, after every opening pillar, the next closing one should be of the same style.

Your job is to determine whether a given temple is in risk of collapsing or not.

The input is a string consisting of characters '[]{}()', at most 1000.
You should output T if the brackets are ordered correctly, F otherwise.
