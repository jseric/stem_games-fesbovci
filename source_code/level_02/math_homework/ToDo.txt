You are employed as a software developer and
you have been assigned N bugs to solve as part of your job.

You are not required to solve all of them, though.
You are required to solve the given problems until exactly M of them remain.

At your disposal are two programs that can help you solve the problems more quickly.

Program A can solve one problem.
Program B can solve half of your problems (rounded down).

The programs are highly complex and consume a lot of processing power.

Each program has its cost given as its processing cost.
As you cannot risk overloading your computer, you need to find the bare
minimum time needed to solve the required number of bugs.

The first line of the input are two numbers separated by a space:
N and M.

The second line are the respective costs of programs A and B,
also separated by a space.

Your output should be a single line containing the minimum cost.

N will never be greater than 100000. The costs will never be greater than 10000.
