Your local space station is about to launch a rocket into space.
However, proper analysis was not conducted and all of the possible
risks have not been addressed.

Your mission is to stop the rocket before it launches and causes possible damage.
The stop codes forn the rocket are encrypted by a bitwise expression.
You need to evaluate the expression in order to figure
out the code to stop the rocket.
The logic expression consists of variable names and operators.

Each variable name is defined as a lowercase letter from
the English alphabet (a-z).

The operators are:
& - bitwise and
| - bitwise or
^ - bitwise xor

Operations have no precedence, they are evaluated from left to right.
The first line of the input contains the logic expression,
with at least 1 character and at most 1000001 characters.

You can expect the expression to always be valid.

All other lines contain a variable name and its 32b value with
the left-most bit being the most significant bit.

You should output a string of 32 bits representing the result of the expression.
